"""Vendored demographic helpers — the pure, in-repo replacement for the two external
``get_pop_data.py`` copies this package used to load by absolute path (CostOfDisease and
CLEWS-OG/OG_simulations). Vendoring removes the machine-bound ``sys.path`` hacks so the
solve path runs on CI / a teammate's box / any checkout.

Provenance (all three functions are dependency-light, numpy-only at the math level):
  * ``total_deaths`` — byte-identical across the CostOfDisease and CLEWS-OG copies (verified).
  * ``extrapolate_demographics`` — from CostOfDisease ``get_pop_data.py`` (the brentq calibration
    in :mod:`ogclews_link.health_pop` reuses it, so the construction matches the paper exactly).
  * ``baseline_pop`` — a thin, UNIVERSAL wrapper over ``ogcore.demographics`` that mirrors the
    country model's OWN ``get_pop_objs`` call (ogcore convention), so the link never reinvents
    demographics. ``ogcore`` is imported lazily inside it so importing ``ogclews_link`` stays
    numpy-only for the transform tests.

    """Baseline population objects via ``ogcore.demographics`` — a thin, UNIVERSAL wrapper that

    ``un_country_code`` is the package's ``UN_COUNTRY_CODE`` (always discovered + passed by og_runner;
    never hardcoded). ogcore fetches from the UN data portal and falls back to the github
    EAPD-DRB/Population-Data repo, writing the raw CSVs to ``download_path`` (a per-run cache).

    The window is ogcore's own convention: ``initial_data_year = start_year - 1`` (the PRE-PERIOD year),
    ``final_data_year = start_year + 1`` — IDENTICAL to what the country model's calibration uses
    (e.g. ogphl/calibrate.py: ``get_pop_objs(p.E, p.S, p.T, 0, 99, country_id=UN_COUNTRY_CODE,
    initial_data_year=p.start_year - 1, final_data_year=p.start_year + 1, ...)`` with NO rates and NO
    pop_dist passed — ogcore fetches + infers internally). Passing ``initial_data_year = start_year``
    (the link's old choice) left the inferred ``g_n`` growth-rate path shifted by a year; this matches
    the country baseline exactly.

    We ALSO fetch the raw rate inputs over the SAME window (``get_pop``/``get_fert``/``get_mort``/
    ``get_imm_rates`` with start_year=start_year-1, end_year=start_year+1) for ``total_deaths`` and the
    health channel's mortality-shock aux — these do not feed back into ``get_pop_objs`` (it fetches its
    own), they are only the rate aux :mod:`ogclews_link.health_pop` needs.

    Returns the 8-tuple
    ``(pop_dict, pop_dist, pre_pop_dist, fert_rates, mort_rates, infmort_rates, imm_rates, deaths)``.
    ``pre_pop_dist`` is the leading (start_year-1) row, kept only to preserve the return contract /
    ``_pop_aux`` (no consumer feeds it back to get_pop_objs). ``ogcore`` is imported lazily so this
    module stays numpy-only at import time."""
