"""Bidirectional ``disease_pop``: the CostOfDisease age-profile mortality method, generalized so the
excess-deaths target may be NEGATIVE (lives saved -- the cleaner-air / pollution direction) as well
as positive (the HIV / disease-burden direction the published code handles).

    rho(s,t) = rho0(s,t) + shock_scale * h(s) * t/phase_years          (clipped to [0, 1])

for the ``phase_years`` MODEL years, where ``t`` runs 1..phase_years. The rate arrays carry a leading
PRE-PERIOD row (year start_year-1, the ogcore data window's first row) that is NEVER shocked -- you
cannot shock history -- so the ramp lands on rows 1..phase_years and row 0 stays at the baseline rate.

``shock_scale`` is solved so the realized year-``phase_years`` excess deaths equal the (signed)
target; then the population path is recomputed with the built-in ``ogcore.demographics.get_pop_objs``.
The demographic helpers (``total_deaths`` / ``extrapolate_demographics``) are vendored in
:mod:`ogclews_link._demog` (identical to the CostOfDisease construction) so this module no longer
loads CostOfDisease by absolute path.

Two generalizations over the published ``disease_pop``: a 0.0 floor (so a reduction can't drive a
rate negative) and a signed root search that does not assume monotonicity. The realized
year-``phase_years`` excess-deaths curve need NOT be monotone in ``shock_scale`` (survivorship
feedback: people whose deaths are averted in early years age into other mortality bands; the 0.0 clip
saturates), so the search scans a geometric grid outward from 0 and brackets the FIRST sign change --
the smallest-magnitude shock that hits the target -- then reports the true achievable extremum if the
target is infeasible. This is correct whenever the curve is monotone up to the first root (the
realistic mortality case) and tolerates a turn-around after it; it does not chase a second root that
rises and falls entirely within one grid interval (not a regime real age profiles produce).

    """Recompute the population under a (signed) excess-deaths age-profile mortality shock.

    ``aux`` is the stashed baseline demographic dict (pop_dist, fert_rates, mort_rates, infmort_rates,
    imm_rates) produced by :func:`ogclews_link._demog.baseline_pop`. Because that wrapper now uses
    ogcore's window convention, the FIRST row of every rate array is the PRE-PERIOD year
    (start_year-1) and ``aux["pop_dist"][0]`` is that pre-period population row. Returns
    ``(pop_dict, shock_scale)``: the pop_dict goes straight into ``p.update_specifications(...)`` before
    solving, exactly as CostOfDisease/main.py does.

    The get_pop_objs call passes the SHOCKED mortality (so it stays a pass-rates inference), aligned to
    ogcore's convention: ``initial_data_year = start_year - 1`` (the pre-period), ``final_data_year =
    start_year + ny - 1``, giving ``T0 = ny + 1`` data rows -- the leading pre-period row plus the ``ny``
    model years. The rate arrays are extrapolated to that T0; ``calibrate_shock_scale`` leaves the
    pre-period row unshocked and ramps the ny model years.

    IMPORTANT -- this omega is NOT comparable to :func:`ogclews_link._demog.baseline_pop`'s omega. This
    call uses ``infer_pop=True`` seeded from a SINGLE population row with ``final_data_year =
    start_year + ny - 1`` (T0 = ny+1); ``baseline_pop`` uses ``infer_pop=False`` with ``final_data_year =
    start_year + 1`` (T0 = 3), letting ogcore fetch the OBSERVED multi-year UN population. Differencing
    the two omegas is dominated by that construction mismatch (single-age age-heaping + a window kink),
    ~1000x larger than and orthogonal to the mortality signal. The CLEAN mortality marginal is THIS
    shocked omega minus a ZERO-shock ``disease_pop`` omega (same window, same seed, same inference -- only
    ``mort_rates`` differs); that difference is smooth and tracks the age profile. Never diff the shocked
    omega against ``baseline_pop``'s omega."""
