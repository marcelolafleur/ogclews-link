"""Target a scenario at a SUB-GOOD inside an aggregated industry / consumption group --
generically, from whatever OG country package is installed.

A multi-industry OG calibration aggregates fine SAM sectors into M production industries
(its ``PROD_DICT``) and fine commodities into I consumption goods (its ``CONS_DICT``). The
model then runs at THAT resolution: one productivity/price/output per group, with no
within-group detail and no substitution between a group's members. The SAM, however, still
carries the fine detail. So a scenario can be TARGETED at a sub-good (electricity, water,
...) even when the calibration joins it with others -- by weighting a shock to the group
that contains the sub-good by the sub-good's SHARE of that group::

    weighted_shock = (sub-good's share of the group) x (requested sub-good shock)

This is the first-order pass-through of a sub-good price/productivity change to the
composite (the composite-commodity / two-stage-budgeting result). The model still RESPONDS
at the group's resolution; that response is interpretable as the sub-good's own only insofar
as the sub-good DOMINATES the group. When it does not -- a small sub-good in a big group, or
a sub-good split across several groups -- the result is dominated by aggregation error, so
this module flags that explicitly rather than letting a diluted number look clean.

Nothing here is country-specific. Groups come from the installed package's ``PROD_DICT`` /
``CONS_DICT`` (or any dict you pass); shares come from its SAM; the sub-good is named by SAM
code(s) or a regex. A future calibration with different sectors, a different M, or a
different ordering just works -- there are no hardcoded names, indices, or carriers. Where a
calibration already isolates the sub-good (a standalone "Energy" industry, say), the share is
~1 and the shock passes through clean -- the same call, no warning.

The bright line this module respects: it WEIGHTS A SHOCK to an EXISTING aggregate (a
scenario-layer act -- the calibration's Z/gamma/io_matrix are untouched). It never SPLITS an
industry into finer ones; that is a recalibration and belongs to the country model.

``locate``/``weighted_shock`` also return the group's INDEX, so this doubles as the
"which industry is energy" discovery: ``locate(PROD_DICT, "electricity")[0][0]``.
