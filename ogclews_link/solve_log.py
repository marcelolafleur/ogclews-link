"""Distill a persisted OG-Core solve log into a concise failure verdict.

When a solve fails, the question is always the same: WHAT phase failed (steady state, the gamma
continuation, or the reform transition path) and WHY (did it converge, hit the iteration cap, diverge
to NaN, or stall?). ``runtime._run`` streams every solve to a ``solve.log``; this reads that file and
returns just enough to answer those questions -- it never reproduces the whole log. Pure text parsing,
no ogcore import, so it runs in the link env.
