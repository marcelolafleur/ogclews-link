"""The SS-phase solves must run IN-PROCESS (client=None); the dask client is TPI-only.

Measured 2026-08-14 (same machine, same calibration, same solvers): routing SS evaluations
through the dask client costs ~30x per evaluation — anchor 866 s via client (the v16 record)
vs 26.5 s in-process; the whole M=8 SS continuation 89.8 s in-process vs ~42 min via client.
The example script (OG-PHL run_og_phl_multi_industry_calibrated.py) has always done it this
way: SS with client=None, the Client created only for the TPI. This guard exists because the
divergence sat unnoticed in the runner through every blessed coupled run — a config-level
audit ("same Client(), same runner() call") passed while the per-phase behavior differed.
